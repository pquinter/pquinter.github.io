I am a biological scientist in transition to full-time computational biology.
I did my PhD in Biology at [Caltech](https://www.caltech.edu).
I worked with worms and yeast, mainly using microscopy and sequencing to 
better understand the mechanism of gene activation.
You can find my publications from graduate school [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=ERRyb1sAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao) 
and my CV [here](/cv).

Professionally, I am thinking about how to leverage RNA biology to develop therapeutics, as
a Scientist in Computational Biology at Flagship VL59, Inc in Cambridge, MA.
