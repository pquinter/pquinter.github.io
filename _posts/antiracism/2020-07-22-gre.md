In September of 2013, I took the Graduate Record Examinations (GRE) General Test.
My score was around 152/170 for both verbal and quantitative reasoning, and
3.5/6.0 for analytical writing. 
With these scores, I ranked around the 50th percentile verbal and quantitative,
and 40th percentile writing.
According to [Caltech's
admissions](https://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/admissions/FAQ), "on average,
admitted students score in the top 90th percentile". 
I was demoralized.

During that time, I was taking classes, helping my non-english speaking
professors write my own letters of recommendation, thinking about research, 
trying to organize an international scientific conference with around 10
invited scientists from the US and 400 attendees from Mexico and Latin America,
and scrambling to put together applications for graduate school with the only
guidance of blogs and university websites online.

A few weeks after my test, I received an email:
<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.2em;">
"Our records indicate that you took a GRE® test at least 30 days ago. If you are
planning to retake the test, you are eligible to do so."
</span>

I had time to take the GRE once more, in time to submit my graduate school
applications.
Over the following weeks I memorized 1,000 english words, most of which I don't
remember, downloaded a pirated GRE guide, and practiced.
The month went by, and I took the test again.
This time, I scored 164 for verbal reasoning, 160 for quantitative, and 4.5 for
analytical writing.
93rd, 76th, and 78th percentiles, respectively.
Better, although still not the top 90th percentile.

In Mexico, a country where the average monthly income is less than $1,000, I
grew up with privilege.
In hindsight, I can see what this increase in my GRE score reflected was this
very privilege: to have the time and money to pay and prepare for the test;
to pay for a second chance; 
and to overcome the belief that my original score was not an unfixable measure
of my ability to succeed, a challenge that was magnified by the false
impression that only geniuses could work in the top universities of the world.

In 2016, as a graduate student in Caltech, I had the opportunity to teach a
1-week science workshop for college students in Mexico as part of [Clubes
de Ciencia](https://www.clubesdeciencia.mx). 
Towards the end of the workshop, I talked about the path to graduate school in
the US; one of my slides contained the table below.

| GRE            | $205.00 |
| TOEFL          | $180.00 |
| Application Fee| $100.00 |
| Shipping       | $40.00 |
| Translations   | $20.00 |
| Total          | $545.00 |

**Table 1: Costs of graduate school application in the US for a student in
Mexico**

The students in the workshop had been selected from a pool of highly motivated
applicants eager to become scientists. 
I tried to convey to all of my students what in my experience had been the best
path to becoming a scientist as a college student in a developing country. 
I told my GRE story, and what I had discovered back then: you will get
the score that you prepare for. 

In a country where $545 represents half the average monthly income, it did not
occur to me to put my words in the context of my privilege of time and money.
But more congruently, I also did not think it relevant to bring up the GRE
preparation material and [courses costing extra hundreds of
dollars](https://www.kaptest.com/gre/comparison/prep-course-options), whose
quality I could not even vouch for from personal experience.

To my surprise, 2 years later one of my students from that 2016 workshop
reached out for advice to apply to graduate school.
He was one of the 4 Mexican students I had the opportunity to closely advise in
their applications.
Every time, I witnessed the same GRE story, my own story except with less privilege.

Working in a lab full-time doing research, doing the very job that proved they
could do well in graduate school, these 4 students also needed to find the time
to prepare for the GRE. 
They had to find the money to pay for taking the test and traveling to the test
site.
They had to stress about not being prepared to take the GRE, dreading to face
their minds' value being degraded by a supposedly objective score that never
since its establishment has correlated with research sucess, but nevertheless
carries Caltech's seal of approval.

Every time, their GRE experience would lead these students, whose talent had
convinced me to invest my time in advising them,
to use the GRE requirement as a major criterium to choose which schools not to
apply to.
The existence of [curated
lists](http://theskyisnotthelimit.org/student-resources) with programs that do
not require the GRE suggests this effect is pervasive.

The plots below show people of color on average score lower than Asians and
Whites in the GRE, and women consistently score lower than men.

**Figure 1: 2019 Mean GRE General Test Scores by Racial/Ethnic group and gender (U.S.
Citizens).** Groups are sorted by mean score and error bars are standard
deviation. 
[Data from ETS](https://www.ets.org/s/gre/pdf/snapshot_test_taker_data_2019.pdf), the company that sells GRE tests.

ETS explains the correlation above [as follows](https://www.ets.org/s/achievement_gap/about/): 
"The achievement gap in education refers to the different levels of academic
performance of students from a variety of racial, ethnic and economic
backgrounds. The lack of access to high-quality education in a child's early
years has a deep and enduring impact on development and academic achievement."
I could not find scientific support for this statement on ETS's website, so I
assume they claim this *achievement gap* and *impact on development* is
measured by their own tests.

In contrast, multiple attempts have failed to find a correlation between the
GRE score and the number of first-author publications, likelihood of
graduation, time to PhD defense, or any informative metric of graduate school
success 
[

].
My own experience is an example of how privilege alone can substantially improve
a GRE score, and it would be almost redundant given the current climate to show a
plot with the correlation between the racial groups above and privilege.

Being in the even more privileged position of having completed my PhD in Caltech, 
having done research that measures up to the work of my talented
peers, and proved to myself that I am able to succeed in academia,
I can see more clearly that privilege is the only thing a GRE score correlates with.
It is now easier to see with evermore frustration and conflict that to date, an
institution where we pride ourselves in being leaders in science and
engineering, in analyzing and interpreting data, continues to justify and use
the GRE as a disguised gatekeeper that specifically keeps out less
privileged talent in spite of overwhelming evidence against its use.

[Data from Caltech](http://www.gradoffice.caltech.edu/documents/7352/AppInstructions_Required_Tests-NG-10-23-19.pdf)
and personal communications. 

In my own experience, and during my time advising applicants and talking to
Caltech faculty with admissions experience, I have observed at least 3 ways in
which the GRE negatively impacts our applicant pool.
The first impact is that it 
**outright prevents some students from applying**,
working as a privilege filter that is invisible to all of Caltech's admissions
committees and is most effective in filtering out the less privileged, women
and people of color.

The second impact is **demoralization**, discouraging applicants from believing
in themselves in spite of the creative efforts many of them were required to
devise to even get to the position where they could apply, working as a
privilege filter that is most effective in degrading the less privileged,
women and people of color.

The third impact occurs when **faculty in the admissions committees look at a GRE
score that is low by Caltech standards, and see** not perseverance to find all
the resources to take the GRE and overcome the lack of privilege but exactly
the opposite,
**less promise to succeed**, an artifact that is most effective in discrediting the
less privileged, women and people of color.

It is utterly disappointing to come to the realization the GRE is an evident
racist, misogynistic policy that is pervasive in Caltech.
As an alumnus, proud to have completed my PhD in this institution, I
believe we can and must do better.

[Only 6% and 31%](https://registrar.caltech.edu/records/enrollment-statistics) 
of Caltech's graduate students identify as underrepresented minorities and
women, respectively.
Why do we lack women and people of color on campus?
How do we address this lack of diversity?
I acknowledge these are challenging questions. 
The Black Scientists and Engineers of Caltech have
[proposed](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1d_Peq8uJViDh_311ItcOpR3KtiAZKH8X/view)
ways forward. 
Dropping the GRE is an embarrasingly obvious first step. 
Below is another promising recipe.

<span style="font-family:Helvetica; font-size:1.3em;">
"Admit racial inequity is a problem of bad policy, not bad people.\\
Identify racial inequity in all its intersections and manifestations.\\
Investigate and uncover the racist policies causing racial inequity.\\
Invent or find antiracist policy that can eliminate racial inequity.\\
Figure out who or what group has the power to institute antiracist policy.
